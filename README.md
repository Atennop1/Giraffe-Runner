## About project

This is the repository for my first game, it's called "Savanna sprint: Two Worlds". This is my first serious creation in Unity, which I made for a very long time and released to the app store. This is a runner game with two modes: 2D and 3D, which differ in gameplay and camera angle. Also in the game there are skins, bonuses, settings and achievements. After a while, the Yodo1 company became interested in the game and we formed a partnership ;)

The repository contains 2 branches: master, which contains the game code as of 07/19/2022, and Redesign, which contains the redesigned code. Redesigned code is still bad, but thanks to him I feel my progress

Fun fact: initially, the game was called "3D(?) Runner", but this name seemed to me difficult to understand and, in principle, somehow uncool. I recently asked ChatGPT to generate a new title and after a couple of attempts it called the game "Savanna sprint: Two Worlds", which I quite liked ;)

## Conclusion

The contribution of this project to my development can hardly be overestimated. Thanks to him, I got acquainted with all the basic things in Unity on practive, thanks to him I understood how advertising works in games, I understood how to upload games to the store, I made myself a developer account. But there were also bad moments. Once I decided to rewrite the code to make it better, but in the end it dragged on for a long time and gave me almost nothing. But I realized that rewriting projects is pure evil. This is my first project, which I perceive as a son <3
